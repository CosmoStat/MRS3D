; NAME:
;    mrs3d_almn2cube
;
; PURPOSE:
;    Reconstructs the density field from almns on one of the 12 base areas
;    of the Healpix sphere (which gives 2D pictures) for increasing radial 
;    values.
;
; CATEGORY:
;    IDL Interface to external facility
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    cube = mrs3d_almn2cube( qlnTable, almn_in, nside, nr, rmin, rstep )
;
; INPUTS:
;   qlnTable : FITS file with tabulated values of Bessel zeros  
;   almn_in  : Input almn stored in a FITS file
;   nside    : Resolution of the Healpix maps, and size of the 2D images
;in the output data
;   nr       : Number of layers of reconstructed maps to compute
;   rmin     : Starting value for the radius of the reconstructed maps
;   rstep    : Distance between two consecutive layers
;
; OUTPUTS:
;    cube : output data of size nside*nside*nr. Each cube[*,*,i] is a 2D
;image of size nside*nside.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;     HELP     = If set, this documentation header is shown
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;   Only compute the first base area of the Healpix Sphere.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;   MRS3D_ExtractCubeFromAlmn_IDL
;
; EXAMPLE:
;    cube = mrs3d_almn2cube( 'qln.fits', 'almn.fits', 256, 128, 100, 1 )
;    tvscl, cube[*,*,0]
;    ivolume,cube
;
; will plot the density extracted at radius 100 Mpc/h from almn.fits on
; 1/12 of the sphere. Then it will plot a 3D density in a cube (scales 
; respected)
