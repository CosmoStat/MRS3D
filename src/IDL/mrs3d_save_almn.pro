; NAME:
;    mrs3d_save_almn
;
; PURPOSE:
;    Save Spherical Fourier-Bessel coefficients in a FITS file.
;
; CATEGORY:
;    IDL Interface to external facility
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    mrs3d_save_almn, almn_out, rmax, almn_in
;
; INPUTS:
;   almn_out : FITS file in which to store the almn coefficients
;   rmax     : Value of rmax used for the computation of the almn
;   almn_in  : Input complex array of size [lmax+1,mmax+1,nmax]
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;   HELP     = If set, this documentation header is shown
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;    Creates a new FITS file to store the computed almn.
;
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;
; PROCEDURE:
;   MRS3D_saveAlmn_IDL
;
; EXAMPLE:
;    almn = mrs3d_load_almn( 'almn.fits' )
;    almn[*,0,0] = 0
;    mrs3d_save_almn, 'almn_modified.fits', 250.0, almn
;
; will load a set of almn coefficients, modify them and store them
;back in a FITS file. NOTE : the value of Rmax (here 250.0) is normally
;displayed by mrs3d_load_almn.
