; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;   HELP     = If set, this documentation header is shown
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;    Creates a new FITS file to store the density field.

;
; EXAMPLE:
;    field  = mrs3d_load_field('field.fits')
;    field  = field + randomn(1,256,256,256)   ;in the case of 256^3 field
;    mrs3d_save_field, 'field_noisy.fits', 250.0, field
;
; will load a density field, add a gaussian noise and store it back
; in a different file.
