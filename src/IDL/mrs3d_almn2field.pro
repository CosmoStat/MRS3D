; NAME:
;    mrs3d_almn2field
;
; PURPOSE:
;    Reconstructs a cartesian density field from Spherical Fourier-Bessel
;coefficients.
;
; CATEGORY:
;    IDL Interface to external facility
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    mrs3d_almn2field, qlnTable, almn_in, field_out, field_nside, field_size, healpix_nside 
;
; INPUTS:
;   qlnTable      : FITS file with tabulated values of Bessel zeros  
;   almn_in       : Input almn stored in a FITS file
;   field_out     : Output field FITS file
;   field_nside   : Number of voxels along one side of the cube
;   field_size    : Physical size of one edge of  the field (Mpc/h)
;   healpix_nside : Resolution of the Healpix maps used for the reconstruction
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;    HELP     = If set, this documentation header is shown
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;   Creates a new FITS file to store the reconstructed field.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;    The name specified in field_out must be available. The reconstructed field
;is not perfect due to losses in the spherical to cartesian conversion, the quality
;of the reconstruction improves with healpix_nside.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;   MRS3D_AlmnFileToFieldFile_IDL
;
; EXAMPLE:
;    mrs3d_almn2field, 'qln.fits', 'almn.fits', 'field.fits', 512, 250.0, 512
;    field = mrs3d_load_field('field.fits')
;    ivolume, field
;
; will plot the 3D density cube reconstructed from almn.fits.
