; NAME:
;    mrs3d_save_cln
;
; PURPOSE:
;    Save discretized power spectrum in a FITS file.
;
; CATEGORY:
;    IDL Interface to external facility
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    mrs3d_save_cln, cln_out, rmax, cln_in
;
; INPUTS:
;   cln_out : FITS file in which to store the cln coefficients
;   rmax    : Value of rmax used for the computation of the cln
;   cln_in  : Input array of size [lmax+1,nmax]
;
; OUTPUTS:
;
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;    HELP     = If set, this documentation header is shown
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;    Creates a new FITS file to store the cln.
;
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;
;
; PROCEDURE:
;   MRS3D_saveCln_IDL
;
; EXAMPLE:
;    cln = mrs3d_almn2cln('almn.fits')
;    mrs3d_save_cln, 'cln.fits', 250.0, cln
;
; will compute the power spectrum from almns and then store it in a FITS file.
; NOTE : the value of Rmax (here 250.0) is normally displayed by mrs3d_load_almn.
